Android native plugin placeholder:
- Implement a MethodChannel plugin 'usage_plugin' in Kotlin/Java inside android/app/src/main/kotlin/...
- Use UsageStatsManager to query app usage (requires PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS permission - user must enable in Settings).
- For blocking apps you will need AccessibilityService and explicit user consent.

This file is a placeholder with instructions.
